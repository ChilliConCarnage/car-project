I kow that there is a bug when you press enter whithout 
inputing anything on the betting screen.
plans for the next update:
 rewrite the car making/recognisation to make the code 
more compact
add more bookie statements and improvements
and maybie add permanent saves so that your game doesnt 
restart whenever you quit it.
